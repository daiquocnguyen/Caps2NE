This program provides the implementation of our unsupervised node embedding model Caps2NE as described in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04822.pdf) where we use a capsule network to unsupervisedly learn embeddings of nodes in generated random walks.

## Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow 1.x
- scikit-learn

### Training
Regarding the transductive setting:

	$ python train_Caps2NE.py --embedding_dim 128 --name cora.128.10.trans.pickle --batch_size 64 --num_sampled 256 --iter_routing 1 --learning_rate 0.00005 --model_name cora_trans_iter1_3

Regarding the inductive setting:

	$ python train_Caps2NE_ind.py --embedding_dim 128 --nameTrans citeseer.128.10.trans.pickle --nameInd citeseer.128.10.ind1.pickle --idx_time 1 --batch_size 64 --iter_routing 1 --num_sampled 256 --learning_rate 0.00005 --model_name citeseer_ind1_3

### Notes

File `utils.py` has a function `sampleUniformRand` to randomly sample 10 different data splits of training/validation/test sets. I also include my 10 different data splits in `dataset_name.10sampledtimes`. You can see command examples in `commands.txt`.
